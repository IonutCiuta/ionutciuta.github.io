## My Name

__IonuÈ›__ - pronounced like _yo-nuts_ - is my preffered name and it's a diminutive of my my real Romanian ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ name __Ioan__ - pronounced like _e-one_.

The English ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ equivalent of __Ioan__ is __John__ and that would __IonuÈ›__ the equivalent of __Johnny__.

Many of my friends and work acquitances refer to me as __John__ so if that's easier for you please do the same. That's where the username `@johnofardeal` comes from.
