# Credxp

Credxp was a start-up I (right), [Liana]({{< param credxp.people.li >}}) (center) and [Robert]({{< param credxp.people.ro >}}) (left) co-founded back in 2018 after we got admitted in the [Innovation Labs]({{< param credxp.links.ilabs >}}) pre-accelerator program. We were what you'd call a fintech start-up and during our 2 year collaboration we worked on building a Machine Learning based service focused on improving the analysis of corporate credit applications.

### Credxp on I Like IT

Although I did not have a TV cable subscription at the time (still don't) and I would have rather used the time and energy required to prepare for this interview to continue working on the product, I must admit it was a sureal moment to appear on what was the most popular Romanian TV tech show at the time. If nothing else, at least our parents could see us on the small screen.

## Media Appearances

During our time as Credxp, we had the opportunity to talk with some leading voices in the local tech media and use their platforms to share our ideas about the state of technology, education, entreprenuership and the product we were building. 

### StartUp.ro article from the early stages

Our first ever interview as a team was definitely an experience to remember. It's interesting to see how our understanding of the product and tech eveovled over time. You can find the full article written by Vlad Andriescu [here]({{< param credxp.links.startupro >}}).

### Innovation Labs Demo Day interview
I thought it would be fitting to follow our first interview with the one we gave at the end of the Innovation Labs program on Demo Day in which we discuss where we got and what we built after a few months fileed with lots of pizza üçï coffee ‚òïÔ∏è and code ‚å®Ô∏è

### Interview for Radio Romania 3 Net
In late 2018 we were lucky enough to share our ideas around the educational process in Romania, local perspectives for students and technology enthusiasts and the changes generated by ML with Radio3Net.

### Interview for RFI Romania

In April 2019 we had the opportunity to chat with Mirel Bran, adding a new entry in the "We come from the future" series. Our discussion was focused on the future of technology in the context of the ML emergence and the startup ecosystem in Bucharest. You can listen to our conversation [here]({{< param credxp.links.rfi >}}).

## Lessons Learned
Although some time has passed, I still have a todo item somewhere specifically for extracting these lessons and posting them somewhere. I never did write the list, but I often thought about what the intro should be. I'm not sure who the quote is actually attributed to, but it goes something like this: 

_The only people who never fail are those who never try._
