# About me 👨🏻‍💻

Hi 👋🏻 nice to meet you! I'm Ionut and I'm a software engineer 💻

For the past 2 years, I've been living in [Cluj-Napoca]({{< param about.links.cluj >}}) 📍 Prior to moving here, I lived in [Bucharest]({{< param about.links.buc >}}) for several years.

When I'm not coding, I'm either [running]({{< param about.links.run >}}) the local trails 🏃🏻‍♂️ [reading]({{< param about.links.books >}}) interesting books 📖 or just worrying about not having time to edit the thounsands of [photos]({{< param about.links.insta >}}) 📸 I've taken during some recent trip.

I've been less active on social media lately and I prefer - and try - to keep an updated list of [things I'm focusing on now here]({{< ref "now" >}}).

# About this site 🪴

This site is my Internet home base and my personal __digital garden__. I've stumbled across the concept of digital gardening by accident via [Joel Hooks' website]({{< param about.links.hooks >}}) some years ago and I instantly became a fan of the idea.

I've long wanted a place of my own where I could aggregate most of my online existence and I'm glad I finally got around to implementing it.
There still are some features I want to add and I'm mostly looking forward to adding my own [personal canon]({{< param about.links.bschl >}}) inspired by Brendan Schlagel's own and maybe a learning journal similar to [daywreckers.com]({{< param about.links.dayw >}}).

The Internet has played a significant role in shaping who I am as a person. I've been online when blogs were still cool, social media was in its infancy and the web as a whole was entering its golden age. While most of this things might not be true anymore, I hope I'll be able to recapture some of that long gone magic 🔮 in this tiny corner of the www 🌎 If not for everybody, at least for myself.
