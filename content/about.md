# About me 👨🏻‍💻

Hi and nice to meet you! 👋🏻 

I'm Ionuț - here's how you [pronounce that]({{< ref "/name" >}}) - and this is my Internet homebase.

I'm a __software engineer__ with __~10 years__ of hands-on experience which I discuss in detail on my [resume page]({{< ref "resume" >}}).

For the past 4 years, I've been living in the lovely [Cluj-Napoca]({{< param about.links.cluj >}}) 📍 Prior to moving here, I lived in [Bucharest]({{< param about.links.buc >}}) for several years.

When I'm not coding, I'm either [running]({{< param about.links.run >}}) the local trails 🏃🏻‍♂️ [reading]({{< param about.links.books >}}) interesting books 📖 or just worrying about not having time to edit the thounsands of [photos]({{< param about.links.insta >}}) 📸 I've taken during some recent trip.

A lot is happening and so I try to keep a list of things I'm focusing right now [over here]({{< ref "now" >}}).

# Contact 📲

If you want to get in touch with me, your best chance to reach me is [via e-mail]({{< param about.links.mail >}}) ✉️ which I check consistently.

I'm __open__ to work related collaborations if my schedule allows it and I have a good track record of delivering mission critical projects.

If you just want to share a cool idea or chat about any of my other hobbies, you reach out on any of my social media accounts listed on the [homepage]({{< ref "/"  >}}) most of which are are `@johnofardeal` 📲

# About this site 🪴

As mentioned above, this site is my Internet home base and my personal __digital garden__. I've stumbled across the concept of digital gardening by accident via [Joel Hooks' website]({{< param about.links.hooks >}}) some years ago and I instantly became a fan of the idea.

I've long wanted a place of my own where I could aggregate most of my online existence and I'm glad I finally got around to implementing it.
Altough the version you're looking at is complete on its own, there still are some features I'm looking forward to adding. At the top of my list is a [personal canon]({{< param about.links.bschl >}}) inspired by Brendan Schlagel's own and a learning journal similar to [daywreckers.com]({{< param about.links.dayw >}}).

The Internet has played a significant role in shaping who I am as a person. I've been online when blogs were still cool, social media was in its infancy and the web as a whole was entering its golden age. While most of this things might not be true anymore, I hope I'll be able to recapture some of that long gone magic 🔮 in this tiny corner of the www 🌎 If not for everybody, at least for myself.
