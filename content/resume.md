# Resume

__10+ years of experience__ building scalable services and leading technical teams. Proficient in Java, Spring, and cloud technologies, with a focus on delivering high-performance, resilient and scalable systems.

### Background

I started my journey in the software development industry in __2014__, during my 3rd year of college at [UPB ACS]({{< param resume.links.acs >}}) working part-time for a small French start-up.

In the __10+__ years that have passed since then, I had the opportunity to take on various technical challenges as either a FTE, consultant or contractor. I've worked for product companies, consultancy firms and other clients from small startups to large enterprises both as individual contributor and as technical team lead.

Somewhere in between all of these, I co-founded __Credxp__, a __start-up__ which I cover in more detail [here]({{< ref "/credxp">}}).

My focus as a software engineer is on building high-quality, performant, scalable, and resilient systems. I thrive in environments where I can contribute to the entire __end-to-end software lifecycle__, including product analysis & design, requirements definition, architecture, development, performance testing, deployment, and monitoring.

### Looking forward
I enjoy deep diving into __system design & architecture__ topics. Solution architecture and implementation is an important part of what I do. However, I'm interested in leveraging my technical expertise to bridge the gap between engineering and product strategy, potentially in a __technical product management__ role, and I'm actively investing in this area of my skill-set.

### Tech stack

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the technologies I'm familiar with:
* __Languages__: fluent in Java, experience with Kotlin, some experience with Python & JavaScript
* __Frameworks__: fluent in Spring (Boot, Cloud) and other DI frameworks, familiar with various
frontend frameworks like Vue & Angular, some experience with NodeJS & Flask
* __Cloud__: [Kubernetes (CKAD certified in 2024)]({{< param resume.links.ckad >}}), hands on experience with Kafka, familiar
various cloud providers (AWS, GCP , OCI), caching solutions (Redis)
* __Databases__: hands on experience with MySQL, some experience with Postgres and various NoSQL databases
alternatives
* __CI/CD__: GitlabCI, Jenkins, Github Actions, Maven, Helm
* __Monitoring & alerting__: Prometheus, Grafana, Wavefront

### Most Recent Experience

#### 8x8 (2021 - 2025)

Most recently, I worked on implementing a real time push notifications system for a mobile app that offers cloud telephony and messaging. Handling a daily volume of __~10 mil. messages__ for __~400K users__ with an average end to end processing latency from notification generation to provider delivery of __<300ms__.

High level focus on designing an easily scalable microservice oriented system with resilient integrations - be they via __Kafka__ or plain old REST APIs - deployed in the cloud on __Kubernetes__. Low level focus on delivering robust, fault tolerant code that can handle workloads in an async manner using __Javaâ€™s concurrency tooling__ (threads, executors, CompletableFutures).

Lots of __performance__ tuning and testing. Overall focus on code quality, maintainability and __observability__. I owned and managed the entire development lifecycle and took on technical leadership early halfway through the engagement.

__Tech stack__: Java, Kotlin, Spring, AOP, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, AWS services, Grafana, Jenkins

#### Deloitte Technology (2019 - 2021)
I worked on designing, implementing and maintaining various microservices as part of the backend infrastructure for a top UK high-end store with __>1 mil. DAU__. The more significant services were an API for managing and serving order collection points based on various order criteria as well as a management system complete with custom React UI for managing delivery options.

For this project and other engagements under the same contract I've assumed technical leadership role.

__Tech stack__: Kotlin, Spring, Kubernetes, Docker, GitLab CI, GCP services

### Previous Roles

I cover in depth the technical challenges I solved and skill-set I acquired during my time as a co-founder of __Credxp__ [here]({{< ref "/credxp">}}).

Details of my earlier career are available on [LinkedIn]({{< param resume.links.linkedin >}}). I'm happy to provide further information upon request.
