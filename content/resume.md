# Resume

### Then

I started my journey in the software development industry in __2014__, during my 3rd year of college working part-time for a small French start-up. In the __10+__ years that have passed since then, I had the opportunity to take on various technical challenges as either a FTE, consulant or contractor. I've worked for product companies, consultancy firms and other clients of various sizes both as individual contributor and as technical team lead.

Somewhere in between all of these, I co-founded a start-up called Credxp which I cover in more detail [here]({{< ref "/credxp">}}).

### Now
As a software engineer, I'm focused on building performant, scalable & resilient systems while maitaining a high quality standard. I enjoy being involved in the entire lifecycle of the software I'm working on - from understanding the product & business needs to defining the specs, architecture, implementation, testing, deployment & monitoring.

### Next
Although I like deep diving into system design & architecture topics, I think (_at least for now_) that I'd really to try out a __product engineering/management role__ at some point.

### Tech stack
When it comes to hands on experience, I am what you might call a _jack of all trades, master of __some___.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the technolofies I'm familiar with:
* __Languages__: fluent in Java, experience with Kotlin
* __Frameworks__: fluent in Spring (Boot, Cloud) and other DI frameworks, familiar with various
frontend frameworks (Angular, Vue)
* __Cloud tech__: [Kubernetes (CKAD certified in 2024)]({{< param resume.links.ckad >}}), hands on experience with Kafka, familiar
various cloud providers (AWS, GCP , OCI), caching solutions (Redis)
* __Databases__: hands on experience with MySQL, prior experience with Postgres and NoSQL
alternatives
* __CI/CD tech__: GitlabCI, Jenkins, Github Actions, Maven, Helm
* __Monitoring & alerting__: Prometheus, Grafana, Wavefront
* __Other__: worked with earlier versions of the Android SDK, Scala, JavaScript & Python


### Most Recent Experience

#### 8x8 (2021 - 2025)

Most recently, I worked on implementing a real time push notification system for a mobile app that offers cloud telephony and messaging. Handling a daily volume of __~10 mil. messages__ for __~400K users__ with an average end to end processing latency from notification sgeneration to provider delivery of __<300ms__.

High level focus on designing an easily scalable microservice oriented system with resilient integrations - be they via __Kafka__ or plain old REST APIs - deployed in the cloud on __Kubernetes__. Low level focus on delivering robust, fault tolerant code that can handle workloads in an async manner using __Javaâ€™s concurrency tooling__ (executors, threads, CompleteableFutures).

Lots of __performance__ tuning and testing. Overall focus on code quality, maintainability and __observability__. I owned and managed the entire development lifecycle and took on technical leadership early halfway through the engagement.

__Tech stack__: Java, Kotling, Spring, AOP, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, AWS services, Grafana, Jenkins

#### Deloitte Technology (2019 - 2021)
I worked on designing, implementing and maintaining various microservices as part of the backend infrastructure for a top UK high-end store with __>1 mil. DAU__. The more significant services were an API for managing and serving order collection points based on various order criteria as well as a management system complete with custom React UI for managing delivery options.

For this project and other engagemetns under the same contract I've assumed technical leadership role.

__Tech stack__: Kotlin, Spring, Kubernetes, Docker, GitLab CI, GCP services

#### Other

I don't miminize the importance of my previous roles - they contributed significantly to my becoming the professional I am today. However I do think they are less relevant in this context. Still, I can provide details if necessary and I do list them on my [LinkedIn]({{< param resume.links.linkedin >}}) profile.
