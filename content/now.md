# Now

⌨️ Still going strong on my [Leetcode]({{< param now.links.lc  >}}) grind which I started last year on the 1st of Jan. My goal is still to solve at least 1 problem per day and I'm hoping to get the __500 Days Badge__. Most recently, I cleared the __365 Days Badge__. However, the real prize is just feeling how the compounding effect is doing its magic.

🏃🏻 Also training for the first edition of the [Săruni Trail Run]({{< param now.links.saruni >}}) which takes places in my hometown of [Zlatna]({{< param now.links.zlatna >}}). This will be my first competition since taking care of some injuries that kept me running less that previous years. Either way, it's good to be on the trails again!
