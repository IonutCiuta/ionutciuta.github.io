# Now

I'd like to say I'm taking it easy for the holidays 🎅🏻 but I'm prepping for the [CKAD certification]({{< param now.links.ckad >}}) which I'm about to take on the 6th of Jan 2024 ⌨️

I'm also trying to catch up on the [Advent of Code]({{< param now.links.aoc23 >}}) challanges for this year but time isn't on my side 🥲

To top it all off, I'm gathering some stats about all the [books I've read in 2023]({{< param now.links.books >}}). Hoping this'll lead to me writing a blog post 🤞🏻

Happy holidays, see you in 2024! 🎄
